# Welcome to J-NLR

J-NLR (Jax-based Non-Linear Reconciliation and Learning) is a Python package designed for advanced reconciliation and 
learning on nonlinear manifolds. Built on top of JAX, it leverages automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU acceleration to enable efficient and scalable solutions for non-linear reconciliation problems.

## Features
- Non-linear reconciliation of hierarchical forecasts.
- Support for JAX-based models and computations.
- Scalable and efficient implementation for large datasets.
